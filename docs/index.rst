MVDatasets
==========

Welcome to the documentation of the MVDatasets: Standardized DataLoaders for 3D Computer Vision.
Have a look around and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions.
Examples are the best way to get started!

⚠️ This is a work in progress research codebase designed with a focus on modularity; future updates *will try* not to disrupt existing functionalities.
